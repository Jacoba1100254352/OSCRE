### Step-by-Step Process for Radiation-Hardening Simulation

#### 1. **Design the Circuit in xschem**
   - **Objective:** Create a schematic of the circuit to be simulated.
   - **Actions:**
     - Open xschem and draw your circuit, including transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.
     - Save the schematic as `my_circuit.sch`.

#### 2. **Generate Netlist**
   - **Objective:** Export the schematic to a netlist format compatible with NGSpice.
   - **Actions:**
     - In xschem, generate the netlist and save it as `my_circuit.spice`.

#### 3. **Add Verilog-A Models (Optional)**
   - **Objective:** Include detailed radiation effect models for specific components.
   - **Actions:**
     - Write Verilog-A models for components affected by radiation (e.g., transistors).
     - Include these models in the SPICE netlist.

#### 4. **Simulate Circuit with NGSpice**
   - **Objective:** Perform the initial circuit simulation without radiation effects.
   - **Actions:**
     - Run NGSpice to simulate the circuit behavior: `ngspice my_circuit.spice`.
     - Save the simulation output to `ngspice_output.txt`.

#### 5. **Read Simulation Results in C++**
   - **Objective:** Parse the simulation results for further analysis.
   - **Actions:**
     - Use C++ to read `ngspice_output.txt` and store the data in a suitable format (e.g., a vector of `DataPoint` objects).

```cpp
std::vector<DataPoint> readData(const std::string &filename) {
    std::ifstream file(filename);
    std::vector<DataPoint> data;
    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(file, line)) {
        std::istringstream iss(line);
        DataPoint point{};
        if (iss >> point.time >> point.voltage) {
            data.push_back(point);
        }
    }
    return data;
}
```

#### 6. **Inject Radiation Effects**
   - **Objective:** Simulate the impact of radiation events on the circuit components.
   - **Actions:**
     - Use the `CircuitSimulator` class to manage the components and simulate radiation effects.
     - Implement methods to apply radiation effects to each component based on its sensitivity and the type of radiation event.

```cpp
void CircuitSimulator::simulateRadiationEffects() {
    for (ComponentModel *&component: components) {
        component->applyRadiationEffect();
    }
}
```

#### 7. **Aggregate and Analyze Effects**
   - **Objective:** Summarize the cumulative effects of radiation on the circuit.
   - **Actions:**
     - Implement methods in C++ to aggregate the effects of multiple radiation events.
     - Compute metrics such as the Soft Error Rate (SER) and generate reports.

```cpp
double computeAverageVoltage(const std::vector<DataPoint> &data) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (const auto &point: data) {
        sum += point.voltage;
    }
    return sum / data.size();
}

void ReportGenerator::generateReport() {
    // Generate a detailed report based on simulation data
}
```

#### 8. **Visualize Results**
   - **Objective:** Plot the simulation results for better understanding and presentation.
   - **Actions:**
     - Use the `Plotter` class to create visual representations of the data.

```cpp
void Plotter::plotResults() {
    // Code to plot the results
}
```

### Final Result

The final result of this process is a comprehensive analysis of the circuit's behavior under radiation. You will have:
- A netlist generated from xschem and simulated with NGSpice.
- Parsed simulation data read into C++ for analysis.
- Radiation effects simulated on individual components and aggregated for the whole circuit.
- Detailed reports and visualizations of the circuit's resilience to radiation.

This process allows you to systematically assess and improve the radiation hardness of your circuit designs.
