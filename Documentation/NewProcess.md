### Revised Process Outline for the System

1. **Design the Circuit in xschem:**
    - Use xschem to create the circuit schematic, including all components and radiation effect blocks.
    - Save the schematic and generate the SPICE netlist (`my_circuit.spice`).

2. **Define Radiation Effects within xschem:**
    - Add radiation effect parameters directly within the xschem schematic.
    - Ensure these parameters are included in the SPICE netlist.

3. **Simulate Circuit with NGSpice:**
    - Run NGSpice to simulate the circuit using the generated netlist.
    - Use NGSpice's built-in capabilities to handle the radiation effects and specify these effects through the netlist parameters.

4. **Read and Process Simulation Results:**
    - **Internally:** Use C++ to parse the NGSpice output file and process the simulation data.
    - **Externally:** Ensure the processed data is seamlessly reintegrated into NGSpice for visualization.

5. **Analyze and Visualize Results within NGSpice:**
    - Use NGSpice’s plotting and analysis tools to visualize the results.
    - Ensure all results are displayed within the NGSpice GUI, avoiding the need for users to interact with command-line tools or C++ code directly.

### Summary

To align with Dr. Chiang’s requirements:
- The user interface in xschem will allow the specification of radiation effect blocks and parameters.
- NGSpice will handle the simulation and display results within its GUI.
- C++ will be used behind the scenes for complex computations, but users will not interact with it directly.






# Process
To allow users to specify radiation effect blocks and parameters within xschem, you'll need to enhance the schematic editor's capabilities. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create Radiation Effect Symbols in xschem:**
    - Open xschem and create a new symbol for radiation effects.
    - Define the graphical representation of the radiation effect block.
    - Add parameters (attributes) for radiation type, intensity, duration, etc.
    - Save the symbol for reuse in schematics.

2. **Add Radiation Effect Blocks to Schematic:**
    - Place the newly created radiation effect symbols in your circuit schematic where appropriate.
    - Connect these blocks to the relevant circuit nodes/components.

3. **Define SPICE Model for Radiation Effects:**
    - Modify the SPICE model files to include the effects of radiation as specified by the parameters in the radiation effect blocks.
    - This might involve defining new SPICE subcircuits or models that account for radiation-induced faults and behavior changes.

4. **Parameter Passing to NGSpice:**
    - Ensure that the parameters set in the radiation effect blocks are correctly passed to NGSpice during simulation.
    - This involves making sure that the netlist generated by xschem includes the radiation parameters.

5. **Modify NGSpice Scripts:**
    - Adjust NGSpice simulation scripts to handle the additional parameters and simulate the effects of radiation based on these inputs.
    - Use `.control` statements in the SPICE netlist to include the necessary commands for fault injection and radiation simulation.

6. **Run Simulations and View Results:**
    - Use xschem to run the simulations with NGSpice.
    - View the results directly within the NGSpice plotting tools, ensuring that the radiation effects are correctly reflected in the output.

### Detailed Example

#### Creating a Radiation Effect Symbol in xschem
1. **Open xschem:**
   ```sh
   xschem
   ```
2. **Create New Symbol:**
    - Go to `File > New Symbol`.
    - Draw the symbol representing the radiation effect.
    - Add attributes for parameters like `radiation_type`, `intensity`, `duration`, etc.
    - Save the symbol as `radiation_effect.sym`.

#### Adding the Symbol to Schematic
1. **Open or Create a Schematic:**
   ```sh
   xschem my_circuit.sch
   ```
2. **Add Radiation Effect Blocks:**
    - Place the `radiation_effect` symbol in the schematic.
    - Connect it to the relevant nodes/components.

#### Defining SPICE Model
1. **Modify SPICE Model Files:**
    - Create or edit SPICE model files to include radiation effects:
      ```spice
      .subckt radiation_effect N001 N002 PARAMS: (type="gamma", intensity=1.0, duration=1n)
      * Model the effect here
      .ends radiation_effect
      ```
2. **Include Radiation Models in Netlist:**
    - Ensure that the netlist includes the radiation effect subcircuits:
      ```spice
      Xrad1 N001 N002 radiation_effect type="gamma" intensity=1.0 duration=1n
      ```

#### Modifying NGSpice Scripts
1. **Add .control Statements:**
   ```spice
   .control
   run
   * Commands to simulate radiation effects
   plot v(N001)
   .endc
   ```

#### Running Simulations
1. **Run Simulation in xschem:**
    - Use xschem's built-in capabilities to run NGSpice simulations and visualize results.
    - Ensure all parameters and models are correctly interpreted and simulated.
